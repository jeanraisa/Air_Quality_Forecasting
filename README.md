# Air Quality Forecasting With Time Series Analysis

# Project Overview

This project aims to predict air quality levels using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The dataset includes various air pollutants, and the model is trained to forecast air quality based on historical data. The primary goal is to improve model performance by experimenting with different hyperparameters, regularization techniques, and architectures to achieve the best Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

# Dataset

The dataset consists of two files:
* **train.csv** : Used for training the LSTM model.
* **test.csv** : Used for evaluating the model.
